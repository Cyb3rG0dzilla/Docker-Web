Hashed Passwords Disclosed
info-dis

The Admin API endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:9090/app/admin/api/users sends the entire user object to the front end. Even if the application/page rendering this may not display the password, it's critical that only necessary information is sent instead of the entire object

Vulnerable Code snippet

core/apphandler.js

...
db.User.findAll({}).then(users => {
    res.status(200).json({
        success: true,
        users: users
    })
...
Solution

This particular error can be fixed by selecting for only the required attributes from the database

db.User.findAll({attributes: [ 'id' ,'name', 'email']},).then(users => {
    res.status(200).json({
        success: true,
        users: users
    })

Logging of sensitive information
info-dis

By default, Sequelize logs every query using console.log, this could be a serious issue if these logs are stored to disk or worse, sent elsewhere for analytics or other purposes

Solution

To fix this issue, disable logging in Sequelize

// Sequelize connection
var sequelize = new Sequelize(config.database, config.username, config.password, {
    host: config.host, 
    dialect: config.dialect, 
    logging: false
});

Recommendation

Always be wary of where all your data resides or is transmitted to
Send only the minimum information which is essential, even if may not be used
